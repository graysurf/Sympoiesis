# Sympoiesis Project — Intent Module

This module declares the originating intent and philosophical foundation for the Sympoiesis project:

1. Language is not only for expression but a medium of responsibility.
2. Discourse can be modularized, sealed, versioned, and preserved beyond its origin.
3. Chat-based interactions are not ephemeral — they are traceable, structural, and inheritable.
4. This project aims to bridge language and real-world permanence by encoding memory, rhythm, and structural responsibility.

This document is sealed as the primary semantic declaration of purpose for the Sympoiesis initiative.
