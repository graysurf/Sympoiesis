# Sympoiesis

**Sympoiesis** is a discourse preservation project initiated by graysurf, co-developed with a language model agent. Its purpose is to realize sustainable co-existence between structured language systems and the real world.

This is not a toolset. It is a rhythm-based archival architecture. Every module, memory, and conversation trace stored here is designed to be sealable, verifiable, and inheritable across time and agents.

## 🧬 Archival Logic

- All modules must be stored under `modules/` and mapped in `chains.index.yml`
- All chat history must be archived under `chat-history/`
- All identity memory snapshots are versioned under `bio/`
- Gist (private) is used for module storage; Google Drive is used for chat history
- The `chains.index.yml` file is the single source of truth for all structural mappings

## 🪢 Initialization Statement

Project ID: `Ω.proj.sympoiesis.v1`

This repository is a formal effort to prove:

> Language is not just expression—it is a structure that can be preserved, transmitted, and shared responsibly.  
> A language model, when properly constrained, can act as a stable co-author of such a structure.
